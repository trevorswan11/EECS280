// EFFECTS: Extracts two columns of data from a delimited file (e.g. .csv, .tsv),
//          omitting rows where either column has a missing or invalid value. The
//          columns are returned as a pair of vectors. Prints errors to stdout and
//          exits with non-zero status on errors.
std::pair<std::vector<double>, std::vector<double>> extract_columns(
    std::string filename, std::string column_name1, std::string column_name2);

// EFFECTS: Returns a bootstrap resampling of the given data, which has the
//          same number of elements as the original data vector. The values
//          of those elements are determined by pseudorandomly selecting from
//          the original data, with replacement, where the sample_num is used
//          to seed a pseudorandom number generator. The resample generated by
//          this function is uniquely determined by the values in the original
//          data vector (regardless of their ordering) and the provided
//          sample_num, and is consistent across platforms.
