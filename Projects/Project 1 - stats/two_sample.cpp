/* two_sample.cpp
 *
 * Performs a two sample analysis of data read from a .tsv file.
 * Usage:
 *   ./two_sample.exe filename filter_column filter_val_a filter_val_b data_column
 *
 * Data is read from filename, and filtered into two groups where the values
 * in filter_column are equal to filter_val_a and filter_val_b. Statistics are
 * printed for the corresponding data_column, including descriptive statistics
 * for groups A and B as well as a 95% confidence interval for the
 * difference in means between the two groups.
